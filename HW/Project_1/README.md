### Part One: Case Selection

I was inspired to study Zimbabwe after reading a few works on the country's 2008/09 Cholera crisis (Chigudu 2016; Chigudu 2019). The crisis was the result of historically poor management of the country's sewage and water treatment infrastructure, exacerbated by President Mugabe and the ZANU(PF) in office. The damage it caused coupled with poor (if not counterproductive) response from the government decreased trust in and reliance on the government among local township residents, effectively hardening a self-resilience mindset.

Simultaneouly, the crisis had significant international ramifications. Many Western countries responded quickly, but through a perspective of securitization (the cholera outbreak was a hazard to other countries, therefore must be stopped) and human rights (the Mugabe regime was corrupt and exhibited poor quality of governance which resulted in the life-threatening cholera crisis). Conversely, the Mugabe regime accussed the West of encroaching on Zimbabwean sovereignty and spread false narratives -- on public health and politics -- to stay in power.

These incredibly complex dynamics seemed like a great segue into studying the complex systems and the roles of individuals in agent-based modeling. However, the capital, Harare, has too high a population to work with in an intro-level model and on an 8GB RAM computer. Looking to nearby para-urban administrative zones adjacent to Harare, the western districts of Mashonaland East province stuck out as having manageable population sizes. Among these, Seke has a population (110,037 in 2020) in our class's prescribed "Goldilock's Zone" of about 100,000. Further, it is directly south of the sections of Harare which experienced the worst outbreaks and is connected to these areas by the A4 Highway, part of the North-South part of the Trans-African Highway which connects Cairo to Cape Town. This road, among other primary roads in the district is shown later in Figure 5.

### Part Two: Plotting Population Density Across Mashonaland East

To further quality assure Seke as a suitable location to study, I studied the population densities of each district in Mashonaland East (see Figure 2). First, I ruled out the districts with the highest populations (Goromonzi, Murehwa, Marondera) and those which were too far away from Harare (Mudzi, Mutoko, UMP). Of the remaining three, Seke had the median population size, but the highest density. It was a simple and somewhat unscientific method of case selection, though, the distribution of people across the space attracted me it (see Figure 3).
